## **General**

### **How does SupplyAlly work?**
SupplyAlly helps you track whether a person receiving an item has received it before. Before you issue an item to a recipient, use SupplyAlly to scan their NRIC/FIN barcode on a valid identification document. SupplyAlly will tell you if they had collected that item before.

## **Setting Up**

### **How does SupplyAlly work?**
You can download the app here: <https://go.gov.sg/SupplyAlly>. It is available on the Android Play Store and Apple App Store. Ensure that your device has a back-facing camera and a valid mobile number.

### **How do I start using SupplyAlly with the QR code?**
Ensure that your device is connected to the internet. You should have a unique QR code issued to you by your appointed organisation. 

Scan the QR code and input your phone number. You will receive a One-Time Password (OTP) via SMS. Enter the OTP to proceed. Once you have successfully logged in, you may start using the app by scanning NRIC barcodes or manually inputting them.

### **Do I need to scan the QR code each time I use SupplyAlly?**
No, you will be automatically logged in each time you launch SupplyAlly as long as you have not logged out previously. If your QR code has expired, you will need to obtain a new QR code from your organisation.

### **Do I need to log out of SupplyAlly at the end of my shift?**
No, there is no need to log out of SupplyAlly at the end of your shift. 

If you are using SupplyAlly on a shared device, we recommend logging out of SupplyAlly to prevent misuse. You will be able to re-login to SupplyAlly with your QR code and same mobile number.

### **The QR code does not seem to work. What do I do?**
Your QR code might have already been tied to another phone number, or the QR code you are using has expired. 

If you are unable to login with your QR Code, check with your organisation to get a replacement QR code. 

If your organisation is unable to issue you a new QR code, please submit a request on Zendesk or email to <supplyallyhelp@hive.gov.sg> with the following information:
* Your name
* Number of users affected 
* Your organisation or company
* Location where scanning of NRIC took place
* First 13 characters of your QR codes that do not work. This can be found at the left of the QR code (abcdef12-3456...)

## **Scanning NRICs**

### **What are considered valid forms of identification?**
Physical NRIC/FIN cards, birth certificates, driving licence, and SingPass Mobileâ€™s Profile page (barcode feature) are valid forms of identification. Passports and soft copies of NRIC/FIN cards are not valid identification documents.  

### **What do I do if SupplyAlly hangs or does not work?**
If you encounter an issue, try closing the app and opening it again. If it still does not work, please start recording the following details on paper:
* Date/Time of transaction
* NRIC
* Items and quantity received

You will be able to enter the recorded details into SupplyAlly manually later on. If the problem persists, please submit a request on Zendesk.
