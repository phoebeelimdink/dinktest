### **Open source**

We believe distribution efforts are not unique to Singapore and could be reused by other countries. For that reason we opensource our code to allow other countries to bootstrap from our work.

### **Seamless user journey**

From logging in to the scanning of NRICs, the process is fast and straightforward. By creating a low barrier to entry, volunteers can get up to speed quickly with little guidance.

### **Zero-knowledge**

Having no confidential data to begin with gives the team the competitive edge of not having to deal with problems related to data (cleanliness, timeliness, etc). Also, the database does not store any personal identifiable information but only a fingerprint of it.

### **Serverless**

The best way to scale and not worry too much about infra Ops. By delegating the heavy lifting to the cloud provider, we can focus on building the right application and trust that it will be safe and scalable.

### **Dynamic policy & Multi-environment**

With a single application we are able to connect to multiple environments for different policies and distribution. The same application can support both mask distribution, laptop distribution and even more distributions at the same time without additional cognitive workload on the user. Turnaround time for policy update(s) can be done very quickly, to keep up with the new initiatives being rolled out.

### **Development Agility**

The team can get fully developed features from the development environment to the user's device in less than 30 min. This is possible with over-the-air update and automatic CI setups.
